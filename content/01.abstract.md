## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The Bioconductor project enters its third decade with over
two thousand packages for genomic data science, over 100,000
annotation and experiment resources, and a global system
for convenient distribution to researchers.  Impact of the
project on genome biology is attested to by over 60,000 PubMed
Central citations and terabytes of content shipped per month.
This report provides an overview of cancer genomics resources
in Bioconductor.  Approaches to cancer data reuse and integration,
analysis of copy number variation, and methodology for single-cell
and spatial transcriptomics are reviewed. Bioconductor's strategies 
for supporting methods developers and researchers in cancer genomics
are evolving along with experimental and computational technologies.
All the tools described in this report are backed by regularly
maintained learning resources that can be used locally or in
cloud computing environments.
